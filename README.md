## Hi, I'm Janiya👋

## About Me
Currently taking CSC-134 C++ Programming and learning to collaborate with AI tools!

## My Foo 🎯
Very into anything technology. Spontaneous and just want to learn anything I can to get to be an expert. Also love expression through art, and arts and crafts. My foo is being random, like I have never had one thing that I'm solely focused on at a time, but that's what makes life interesting. You could say that my focus is a tapestry of interests rather than a single thread.

## Currently Learning
- 🤖 The c++ programming language
- 🐙 Engineering Graphics
- 💡 Anything code and engineering related

## Fun Fact
Im going with the flow, want to be an engineer while also an expert coder(eventually, not quite there!). I also want to have like 5 different careers becasue I have a lot of interests like sports and art. 

## Find Me
